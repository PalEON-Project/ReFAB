	abstract = {We propose a simple, fully {B}ayesian approach for multivariate receptor modeling that allows for flexible and consistent incorporation of information. The model uses a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution as the prior distribution on source profiles that allows great flexibility in the specification of prior information. Heavy{\^a}tailed lognormal distributions are used as priors on source contributions to match the nature of particulate concentrations. A simulation study based on the Washington, DC airshed shows that the model compares favorably to Positive Matrix Factorization, a standard analysis approach used for pollution source apportionment. A significant advantage of the proposed approach compared to most popularly used methods is that the {B}ayesian framework yields complete distributional results for each parameter of interest (including distributions for each element of the source profile and source contribution matrices). These distributions offer a great deal of power and versatility when addressing complex questions of interest to the researcher. Copyright {\^A}{\copyright} 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sources of particulate matter (PM) air pollution are generally inferred from PM chemical constituent concentrations using source apportionment models. Concentrations of PM constituents are often censored below minimum detection limits (MDL) and most source apportionment models cannot handle these censored data. Frequently, censored data are first substituted by a constant proportion of the MDL or are removed to create a truncated dataset before sources are estimated. When estimating the complete data distribution, these commonly applied methods to adjust censored data perform poorly compared with model-based imputation methods. Model-based imputation has not been used in source apportionment and may lead to better source estimation. However if the censored chemical constituents are not important for estimating sources, censoring adjustment methods may have little impact on source estimation. We focus on two source apportionment models applied in the literature and provide a comprehensive assessment of how censoring adjustment methods, including model-based imputation, impact source estimation. A review of censoring adjustment methods critically informs how censored data should be handled in these source apportionment models. In a simulation study, we demonstrated that model-based multiple imputation frequently leads to better source estimation compared with commonly used censoring adjustment methods. We estimated sources of PM in New York City and found estimated source distributions differed by censoring adjustment method. In this study, we provide guidance for adjusting censored PM constituent data in common source apportionment models, which is necessary for estimation of PM sources and their subsequent health effects.},

@article{grimm1983,
	abstract = {The pollen and sediment stratigraphy of Wolsfeld Lake and French Lake in the Big Woods of southern Minnesota was investigated. Wolsfeld Lake is in the northeastern Big Woods, and French Lake is in the western Big Woods about 1.5 km from the prairie{\^a}woodland border. During the mid{\^a}postglacial, most of the present Big Woods was prairie. Oak woodland began invading prairie about 5000 years ago in the eastern Big Woods, then expanded westward, becoming established near French Lake 2400 years ago. Topography and water bodies, which control fire frequency, strongly influenced where and when woodland invaded prairie. Oak woodland persisted until 300 years ago, when and rapidly expanded and became dominant. The changes from prairie to oak woodland and from oak woodland to {\^a}bigwoods{\^a} must have required reductions in fire frequency, which were probably caused by increased precipitation and possibly decreased temperatures. About 100 years before the expansion of bigwoods, sediment influx increased at the coring site in Wolsfeld Lake, probably because of an increase in runoff and, therefore, precipitation. A conceptual model is presented in which climatic changes trigger vegetation changes, but interactions among the existing vegetational pattern, fire, and topography cause climatic thresholds for vegetation change to vary in space and time.},

@article{davis1986dispersal,
	abstract = {Pollen records for American beech ( Fagus grandifolia ) and eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) compiled from 50 sites in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, show that both species entered the Upper Great Lakes region about 7000 yr B.P., reaching their western and southwestern boundaries between 2000 and 1000 yr B.P. Fagus advanced northward into lower Michigan as a continuous front, except where Lake Michigan posed a geographic barrier. Colonies were established on the far side of the lake after a 1000 year lag, implying that longdistance dispersal across a 100-km wide barrier can occur. The Fagus range may not have been in equilibrium with climate for one or two thousand years before this time, when seeds were dispersed across the lake to Wisconsin. Tsuga seeds may have been dispersed 150 km or more from Ontario to reach Upper Michigan. Scattered colonies were established 6000{\^a}7000 yr B.P. on either side of Lake Michigan, which did not pose a significant barrier to this wind-dispersed species, Tsuga spread rapidly over a large region prior to 5000 yr B.P. Subsequent expansion to the west occurred more slowly, and may reflect gradual climatic changes in northern Wisconsin during the second half of the Holocene. Tsuga's range may have been limited by dispersal, rather than climate, for an unknown length of time prior to 5000 yr B.P. During this period Tsuga was expanding its range rapidly. The study shows, however, that it is difficult to devise rigorous tests to distinguish between dispersal limitations and climate as factors limiting range limits in the past.},
